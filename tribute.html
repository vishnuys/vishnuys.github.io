						<h3>Here are few achievements of Subhash Chandra Bose:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Born in Cuttack, Orissa, India to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi on 23 January 1897.</li>
							<li> Became a member of the Bengal Legislative Council.</li>
							<li> He was strongly influenced by Swami Vivekananda’s teachings and was known for his patriotic zeal as a student. He also adored Vivekananda as his spiritual Guru.</li>
							<li> In 1916, Subhash reportedly beat and thrashed one of his British teachers E F Otten because the professor made a racist remark against the Indian students for which he was expelled from the Presidency College and banished from Calcutta University.</li>
							<li> In December 1921, Bose was arrested and imprisoned for organizing a boycott of the celebrations to mark the Prince of Wales’s visit to India.</li>
							<li> Subhash Chandra Bose’s father wanted him to become a civil servant and therefore, sent him to England to appear for the Indian Civil Service Examination. Bose was placed fourth with highest marks in English.</li>
							<li> Later Bose resigned from the coveted Indian Civil Service and came back to India as his urge for participating in the freedom movement was that intense in April 1921. </li>
							<li> He left home to become an active member of India’s independence movement.</li>
							<li> He, later joined the Indian National Congress, and also elected as the president of the Youth wing party.</li>
							<li> Subhash Chandra Bose worked under the leadership of Chittaranjan Das, an active member of Congress in Calcutta.</li>
							<li> It was Chittaranjan Das, who along with Motilal Nehru, left Congress and founded the Swaraj Party in 1922. Subhash would regard Chittaranjan Das as his political guru.</li>
							<li> Subhash Chandra Bose became a strong leader in Congress and he made brave attempt to mould the entire party differently by opposing the non-violence principles of Mahatma Gandhi.Therefore Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders were hurt and since then they opposed him.</li>
							<li> In the first election of Congress, where many thought the close aide of Gandhi would be elected, Subhash Chandra Bose got elected with higher votes.</li>
							<li> In order to acknowledge outside support and get freedom he journeyed to far away Germany, Japan when it was period of 2nd world war!</li>
							<li> Nehru at that time said “If Subhash would bring soldiers from outside and enter India, then I would be the first person to wield a sword and oppose him.” That was the extent to which he detested Subhash babu.</li>
							<li> Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was against rendering any kind of help to the British during the World War II.</li>
							<li> Subhash Chandra Bose now started a mass movement against utilizing Indian resources and men for the great war.</li>
							<li> From 1941-1943, Bose dissapeared travelling from country to country tracking Indians and raising awareness among them about the state of India under the British control hence recruiting them for the Indian National Army or "Azad Hind Fauj" meaning Independant Indian Army.</li>
							<li>Although it was believed that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose died in a plane crash, his body was never recovered. There have been many theories put forward regarding his disappearance. The government of India set up a number of committees to investigate the case and come out with truth.</li>
